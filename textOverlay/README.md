## Produce demo videos

This is a simple python code to print the predictions and the corresponding probabilities to the testing videos.

You will need to install [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) with Python for using this sample code. In addition to that, you may want to generate the predictions and probabilities using our [RNN](https://github.com/chihyaoma/Activity-Recognition-with-CNN-and-RNN/tree/master/RNN) and [T-CNN](https://github.com/chihyaoma/Activity-Recognition-with-CNN-and-RNN/tree/master/TCNN).

Below is the demo video generated from this TextOverlay.py sample code.
